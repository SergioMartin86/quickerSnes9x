quickerSnes9x is an attempt to optimizing [snes9x](https://github.com/snes9xgit/snes9x). The main aim is to improve the performance of headless re-recording for TASing and botting (See: [JaffarPlus](https://github.com/SergioMartin86/jaffarPlus)) purposes. However, if this work can help regular play emulation, then much better.
